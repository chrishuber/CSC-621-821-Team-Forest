##Overall Goal:\
Image Registration and Fusion in Regards to COVID-19 (tentative)\

##Segmentation and Registration Algorithms:
Group 1 (Islom, Mato): 3D edge-preserving smoothing followed by a threshold-based segmentation technique, 3D Watersheds segmentation and fusion method\
Group 2 (Chris, Vincent): Landmark-based rigid registration with Iterative Closest Point algorithm with manual selection of correspondences using GUI, Intensity-based rigid registration with mutual information maximization\
Group 3 (Alan, ): \

##Assignment Tasks:
